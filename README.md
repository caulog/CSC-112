# CSC-112
Projects from Spring 2021 Fundamentals of CS (CSC112) course in Java

# Course Objectives
1. Use and work with basic structures such as linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, and iterators.
2. Implement Java classes that embody data structures.
3. Use pre-existing implementations such as the Java Collections framework.
4. Formulate and test for pre-conditions and post-conditions.
5. Distinguish between different types of program defects, and understand how testing and debugging are used to correct them.
6. Implement simple sorting algorithms such as insertion sort and selection sort.
7. Implement the sequential search and binary search algorithms.
8. Implement simple recursive algorithms such as binary tree traversal and merge sort.
9. Work competently with commonly used tools for software development.
10. Create custom data structures when appropriate pre-existing classes are not available.
11. Make relative estimates of the running times of alternative algorithms using Big-O analysis.
12. Discuss the idea of using parallel programming as a method to reduce the computation time.
13. Define the metrics of speedup and scalability as measures of performance for parallel algorithms.
